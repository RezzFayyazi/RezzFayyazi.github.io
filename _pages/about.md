# About Me
I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). My research focuses on the responsible use of how **Generative AI** in fast-changing domains like cybersecurity. More specifically, I focus on developing explainebke metrics to evaluate Gen-AI systems against complicated & out-of-distribution threats, while establishing responsible AI agents that ensure accountability and trustworthiness in production security environments.


## 🤝 Collaboration
I am always interested in collaborating on topics related to:
- LLM reasoning & alignment,
- agentic / autonomous security systems,
- explainable generative models, and
- high-trust AI design for critical infrastructure.

Feel free to reach out if you share interests in **Agentic AI** research.

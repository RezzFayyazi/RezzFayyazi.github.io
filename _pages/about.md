I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).  
My research focuses on the **responsible use of Generative AI in fast-changing cybersecurity environments**.  
Specifically, I develop **explainable and reliable metrics** for GenAI systems facing complex, ambiguous, and out-of-distribution threats. I also explore **responsible AI agents** that maintain accountability, traceability, and trustworthiness within production-grade security workflows.

## 🤝 Collaboration

I am always interested in collaborating on topics related to:

- LLM reasoning and alignment  
- Agentic / autonomous security systems  
- Explainable generative models  
- High-trust AI design for critical infrastructure  

If you share interests in **Agentic AI**, feel free to reach out — I’m always open to meaningful collaboration.

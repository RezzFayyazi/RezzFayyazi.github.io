I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). My research specializes on the **responsible use of Generative AI**.  More specifically, I focus on enhancing the reliability, transparency, and accountability of AI systems in real-world applications. By developing **explainable metrics** for GenAI systems facing complex, ambiguous, and out-of-distribution threats, I aim to improve decision-making and build trust in AI-driven solutions. I also explore **responsible AI agents** that maintain accountability, traceability, and trustworthiness within production-grade workflows.


### Research Interests

Explainable & Trustworthy AI – Developing methods that enhance the interpretability and reliability of AI systems.

Adaptability in High-Stakes Environments – Designing AI solutions that continuously learn and adapt to evolving threats.

## 🤝 Collaboration

I am always interested in collaborating on topics related to:

- LLM reasoning and alignment  
- Agentic / autonomous security systems  
- Explainable generative models  
- High-trust AI design for critical infrastructure  

If you share interests in **Agentic AI**, feel free to reach out — I’m always open to meaningful collaboration.
